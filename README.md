## INSTALLATION OF VSCODE AND PYCHARM.
### VS CODE INSTALLATION
* **WHAT IS VS CODE?**\
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight and beginner-friendly code editor used for writing and running Python programs.
* **DOWNLOAD VS CODE**\
Go to the official VS Code download page:
[https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/].\
Choose the version that matches your operating system: Windows, macOS, Linux.

- **INSATLL VS CODE**\
Open the downloaded installer file.\
Follow the installation steps shown on your screen.\
For Windows users, it is recommended to:
  - Check “Add to PATH”
  - Check “Open with Code” (optional but helpful)
* **LAUNCH VS CODE**\
Open VS Code after installation.\
You should see a welcome screen. This means the installation was successful.
* **INSTALL PYTHON EXTENSION**\
Open VS Code.\
Go to the Extensions tab.\
Search for Python.\
Install the extension by Microsoft.

### INSTALLING PYCHARM
* WHAT IS PYCHARM?\
PyCharm is a powerful Python-focused Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that provides tools specifically designed for Python development.
* DOWNLOAD PYCHARM\
Go to the official PyCharm download page:
[https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows]
* INSTALL PYCHARM\
Open the downloaded installer file.\
Follow the installation instructions.\
Use the default settings if you are unsure — they work well for beginners.
* LAUNCH PYCHARM\
Open PyCharm after installation.\
Select New Project when prompted.\
Make sure Python is selected as the interpreter.


## PYTHON LESSONS
### LESSON 1 - INTRO TO PYTHON PROGRAM.

**INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON.**\
Python is a high-level programming language known for its simple and easy-to-read syntax. It is designed to be beginner-friendly while still being powerful enough for professional software development.\
Python is widely used in areas such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, automation, scientific computing, and game development. Because of its clear syntax and large community, Python is one of the best programming languages for beginners to learn.

**CREATING YOUR FIRST PYTHON FILE.**\
**VS CODE:**\
Open a new folder.\

Click on new folder and create a new one for your python files.\
<img width="600" height="800" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/100a1e18-5d57-4cf4-a805-716e63a98de2" />\
Click on new file and name it. Make sure it ends with ".py" to show it is a python file.\
<img width="200" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c44ea43-3c8e-4259-afc8-e4232488fa08" />\
<img width="400" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e8a4cdf-0c9a-422b-a0ee-7ae5836db96f" />\
"print()" is a function that tells python to display whatever value kept in the bracket on the screen.\
"Hello World" is the text that is being displayed after being run.\
Once you're done, run the program and see what it displays.
> [!NOTE]
> ***In VS Code, right-click in your python coding space, select run python file and run it in terminal.***

**PYCHARM**:\
Go to main menu, files.\
<img width="400" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c54d4c39-5a51-4044-bde0-034791563c02" />\
Click on create after naming the python project.\
<img width="600" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0345ed40-b66a-4b84-ad4f-6f67edf2d149" />\
Create a new python file.\
<img width="400" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/775fb9ad-d8b7-42cb-802a-8e7b9ac4145c" />\
It should look like this.\

After that you can now start with typing you first python script.\

Once you're done, run the program and see what it displays.

## EXERCISE 1
1. Try changing the "Hello World" inside the print() to anything like:
- Your name
- Age
- Country
- Math Formula
- Arithmetic operation
- Hobby
- Food


## VARIABLES
Variables store values.\
age = 25 
name = "DANIEL"  
height = 5.6  
print(age, name, height)\

> [!NOTE]
> Variable names should be:
> Descriptive
> Lowercase
> Use underscores(is_students)
## EXERCISE 2
*1. Create variables to store the following:*
*- Name*
*- Age*
*- Food you like*
*- Hobbies*
*2. Print it in a neat format using "f-string".*
*3. Create variables to store numbers in 'a' and 'b'. Use it to the following arithmetic operations.*
  *- Addition(+)*
  *- Subtraction(-)*
  *- Multiplication(*)*
  *- Division(/)*
  *- Exponential(**)*
  *- Modulus(//)*

## DATATYPES
There are different datatypes in python:
* int → Whole numbers (e.g., 10)  
* float → Decimals (e.g., 3.14)  
* str → Text (e.g., "hello")  
* bool → True / False      
<img width="800" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/042b6816-f779-4933-b072-3b1a33ed7363" />\
The "type()" function shows the datatype of your variable.
## EXERCISE 3
1. Create variables with the following values:
   - An integer
   - A float
   - A string
   - A boolean
2. Print the values and the type:
> [!NOTE]
> In order to check the type, use *"print(type())"*.

## INPUT AND OUTPUT
Python can also take input from user and give the result as output.
name = input("Enter your name: ")  
print("Hello", name) 
## EXERCISE
1. Ask user for the following:
   - name
   - age
2. Print the variables accordingly.
### GUIDELINE
*name = input("Enter your name: ")*\
*age = int(input("Enter your age: "))*\
*print(f"My name is {name}.")*\
*print(f"I am {age} yr old.")*
