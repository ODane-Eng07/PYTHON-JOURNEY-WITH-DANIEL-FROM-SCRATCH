# PYTHON-JOURNEY-WITH-DANIEL-FROM-SCRATCH
My Python learning journey from scratch — covering basics, practice problems, and projects which will be covered in the next 12 weeks of programming.
## INSTALLATION OF VSCODE AND PYCHARM.
### VS CODE INSTALLATION
* WHAT IS VS CODE?

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight and beginner-friendly code editor used for writing and running Python programs.

* DOWNLOAD VS CODE

Go to the official VS Code download page:
[https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/]
Choose the version that matches your operating system:
-Windows
-macOS
-Linux

* INSATLL VS CODE

Open the downloaded installer file.
Follow the installation steps shown on your screen.
For Windows users, it is recommended to:
Check “Add to PATH”
Check “Open with Code” (optional but helpful)

* LAUNCH VS CODE

Open VS Code after installation.
You should see a welcome screen — this means the installation was successful.

* INSTALL PYTHON EXTENSION

Open VS Code.
Go to the Extensions tab.
Search for Python.
Install the extension by Microsoft.

### INSTALLING PYCHARM
* WHAT IS PYCHARM?

PyCharm is a powerful Python-focused Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that provides tools specifically designed for Python development.

* DOWNLOAD PYCHARM

Go to the official PyCharm download page:
[https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows]

* INSTALL PYCHARM

Open the downloaded installer file.
Follow the installation instructions.
Use the default settings if you are unsure — they work well for beginners.

* LAUNCH PYCHARM

Open PyCharm after installation.
Select New Project when prompted.
Make sure Python is selected as the interpreter.

##PYTHON LESSONS
#LESSON 1 - INTRO TO PYTHON PROGRAMMING.

After launching your python software programs:
In VS Code:
Open a new folder and name it "PYTHON PROGRAMS".
Click on the folder and then open another folder under it then name it "BASIC PROGRAMS".
Now, create a new file, give it a name and in this file we start with the python programming.

This code prints out whatever is given within the brackets with the use of one of python's built-in functions, "print()". 

EXERCISE
1. Print out the following using the same code format: Integers, Words, Sentences and Arithmetic operations.


In Pycharm:
Go to main menu, files, then open a new project, name it "BASIC PROGRAMS".
Then Click on create.
